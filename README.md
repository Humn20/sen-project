# Periodic Domain Name Server Resolver (PDNSR) Recommender
Periodic Domain Name Server (PDNSR) Recommendation is a web application that keeps track of the performances of various public Domain Name Server Resolvers (such as Google, OpenDNS, Quad9, CloudFare, etc). It reports historial latencies of DNS resolvers, real time results, and predictions of future latencies. The centralized measurement results are continuously updated every 30 minutes. Real time results are pulled whenever a user visits the website and/or refreshes the page. Future predictions are made by machine learning models that are trained on the historical data. The application contains various data visualizations which will show the past performance of the resolvers as well as predict the future performance. This application has dual purposes as it can be used to conduct research or it can be used for individuals who want to find out which resolver has the best performance at a particular location at a given time.
